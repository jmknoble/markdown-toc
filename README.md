A Python tool which creates a Table of Contents for a Markdown document using
the headings in the document as in-document hypertext link references.

## How Does It Work?

It uses jiggerypokery to interpret and create "pseudo-comments" in the
document text which are not rendered in most flavors of
[Markdown][CommonMark], including [GitHub-flavored Markdown][].

> :pushpin: ***NOTE:*** ***markdown-toc*** *only handles the "atx"-style
> headings beginning with `#`, not the "setext"-style using "underlines" with
> `=` or `-`.*

To insert a table of contents in your document, add the following text, at the
beginning of an otherwise blank line and surrounded by blank lines, in the
spot where you want the table of contents to appear:

```
[toc]: #
```

This is the "table of contents token".

Alternatively, you can use a "begin table of contents token" with a matching
"end table of contents token":

```
[begintoc]: #
...
[endtoc]: #
```

Anything between the "begin" and "end" tokens will be replaced with the
generated table of contents.


### How Does It Really Work?

The "table of contents token" and begin/end tokens use the [link reference
definitions][] feature of Markdown to insert a link definition that is not
intended to be referred to anywhere in the document.

As the CommonMark Spec notes:

> A link reference definition does not correspond to a structural element of a
> document. Instead, it defines a label which can be used in reference links
> and reference-style images elsewhere in the document.

A link consisting of only `#` is a valid HTML hyperlink target; it refers to
an empty fragment in the current document.


### Example

This [README][] contains begin/end tokens and serves as an example.  You may
need to view the "raw" source to see them.


## Generating the Table of Contents

Once the token is in your Markdown file, run this script to generate a new
document which includes a table of contents in place of the token.  For
example:

    ./markdown-toc INPUTFILE.md

or:

    python -m markdown_toc INPUTFILE.md

The result is printed to the standard output.

You can rerun this tool using a resulting document as the input, and the
existing table of contents will be replaced by a new one in the output.


### Heading Levels

By default, **markdown-toc** includes all headings (except for the one
starting the table of contents itself) in the resulting table of contents, and
it prints the **Contents** heading as a top-level heading:

```markdown
# Contents
```

However, it is not uncommon for Markdown documents on GitHub (like this
[README][], for example) to use a "top-level" heading as the title of the
document, and only second-level headings or greater throughout the rest of the
document.

You can control what level the **Contents** heading appears at using the
`--heading-level` option:

    ./markdown-toc --heading-level 2 INPUTFILE.md

This results in:

```markdown
## Contents
```

You can also control the "lowest" level of headings included in the table of
contents using `--skip-level`.  For example, to skip top-level headings, usE;

    ./markdown-toc --skip-level 1 INPUTFILE.md

This will omit all headings that start with a sinle `#` character from the
table of contents.

Combined, this looks lik:

    ./markdown-toc --heading-level 2 --skip-level 1

or:

    ./markdown-toc -H 2 -S 1


### More Options

**markdown-toc** has more options.  There's built-in help:

    ./markdown-toc --help


## Pre-Commit Hook

**markdown-toc** has built-in support for use with [pre-commit][] as a
pre-commit hook.  Simply add the following `repo` and `hook` to the `repos`
stanza in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/jmknoble/markdown-toc
    rev: v0.2.4
    hooks:
      - id: markdown-toc
```

This uses the `--pre-commit` to modify Markdown files in place and emit a
message when a file is changed.

You can add arguments to the hook using the `args` keyword; for example:

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/jmknoble/markdown-toc
    rev: v0.2.4
    hooks:
      - id: markdown-toc
        args: ['--heading-level', '2', '--skip-level', '1']
```
